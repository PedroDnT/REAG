# funds_fraud_alert

Statistical fraud detection for Brazilian investment funds, built on public CVM
filings.

The toolkit ingests the CVM's open datasets — informe diário (daily NAV, flows,
quotaholder counts), CDA (portfolio composition) and cadastro (fund registry) —
and runs a battery of detectors over them, producing per-fund findings with
plain-language briefs explaining what was flagged and what would corroborate it.

Detection patterns are drawn from documented cases, notably the Banco Master /
REAG scheme: circular fund-to-fund flows, phantom assets, valuation smoothing,
window dressing, and cross-fund issuer concentration.

> **Findings are leads, not proof.** Every detector produces statistical red
> flags that require corroboration against records this toolkit cannot see —
> subscription ledgers, bank transfers, counterparty documentation. Nothing here
> establishes wrongdoing on its own.

## Install

```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requirements are split so you install only what you need:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `requirements.txt` | Core runtime: pandas, numpy, requests, matplotlib, tqdm |
| `requirements-dev.txt` | pytest, hypothesis, ruff |
| `requirements-optional.txt` | `yfinance`, for the optional market-price validator |
| `requirements-notebooks.txt` | JupyterLab, seaborn, for `notebooks/` |

## Collect data

CVM publishes monthly ZIPs at <https://dados.cvm.gov.br/dados>. `CVMCollector`
downloads and extracts them into `data/raw/`:

```python
from src.collectors.cvm_collector import CVMCollector

c = CVMCollector()
c.download_registro_fundo_classe()   # fund/class registry
c.download_informe_diario(2026, 6)   # daily NAV and flows
c.download_cda(2026, 6)              # portfolio composition
```

Use `registro_fundo_classe`, not the legacy `cad_fi.csv`. Since RCVM 175 the
informe reports by *class*, and almost every record in `cad_fi.csv` has been
cancelled: it joins to 6.6% of the funds that actually report, against 88.9%
for the class registry, which also carries administrator and manager CNPJs.

The monthly CDA arrives as one ZIP of ten to twelve CSVs — eight position
blocks split by asset class, plus summaries. All position blocks are read and
unioned; pass the directory rather than a single file.

**Match the registry to the period.** The registry is a current snapshot while
the informe is historical, so pairing today's registry with an old month drops
funds that had not yet registered. A fund filter that matches nothing is
reported as an error rather than producing an empty report.

## Run an investigation

```bash
python scripts/run_investigation.py \
    --informe  data/raw/inf_diario_fi_202606.csv \
    --cda      data/raw \
    --cadastro data/raw/registro_classe.csv \
    --strict
```

Outputs land in `reports/investigation/<run_id>/`:

- `findings/*.csv` — one file per detector
- `briefs/` — per-entity HTML and Markdown explanations
- `summary.json` — run metadata, finding counts, and which analyzers ran

`--analysis` selects individual detectors; `--help` lists them. There is also a
guided terminal flow at `scripts/investigation_tui.py`.

### Scoping to a subset of funds

By default every fund in the loaded data is investigated. To narrow it:

```bash
# Every fund under one administrator (partial, case-insensitive name match)
--fund-mode administrator --fund-identifier "ACME DTVM" --active-funds-only

# Every fund under one manager
--fund-mode manager --fund-identifier "ACME GESTORA"

# An explicit list
--fund-mode cnpj_list --fund-identifier "12.345.678/0001-90,11222333000181"
```

Names are resolved against the registry, so `--fund-mode administrator` and
`--fund-mode manager` need one loaded. A full month covers every fund in Brazil,
so scoping the first run to one administrator is usually the right move.

**Use `--strict` in automation.** It exits non-zero if any analyzer crashed. A
report with no findings because a detector died looks exactly like a clean
result, and `summary.json`'s `execution` block records which analyzers failed or
were skipped for lack of inputs.

## Detectors

| Area | Modules |
|---|---|
| Flow and NAV | `anomaly_detector` (flow z-scores, PL drops, redemption runs, flow/performance divergence) |
| Fraud schemes | `fraud_schemes` (circular flow, layered funds, asset inflation, shell networks) |
| Portfolio | `enhanced_phantom_assets`, `portfolio_reconciliation`, `concentration`, `cost_basis_analyzer` |
| Valuation | `valuation_smoothing`, `window_dressing`, `price_divergence`, `benford_law` |
| Structure | `cross_fund_issuer`, `manager_network`, `fund_lifecycle`, `quotaholder_analyzer`, `peer_comparison` |
| Market data | `market_data` — optional, requires `yfinance` |

All of these are selectable with `--analysis`; `--help` lists the values.

### Two ways to detect price manipulation

`price_divergence` works entirely offline: for each asset held by two or more
funds on the same date, it compares each fund's declared unit price
(`VL_MERCADO / QT_POS`) against the cross-fund median. It needs no external API
and covers unlisted credit — CRI, CRA, debêntures, cotas — which is where
mismarking is most likely.

`market_data` compares declared prices against real B3 closes via `yfinance`.
It is optional because yfinance scrapes Yahoo's undocumented endpoints and only
covers listed equities and ETFs. Install `requirements-optional.txt` to enable
it.

## Reports

```bash
python scripts/generate_public_report.py --format html --output reports/public.html
```

Produces an anonymized summary (fund CNPJs replaced with opaque IDs) in
Markdown, HTML or JSON.

## Tests and evals

```bash
pytest -q -m "not eval"   # unit, integration and property tests
pytest -q -m eval         # detection-quality evaluations
ruff check .
```

The eval suite is separate from the tests. It builds synthetic fund universes
with *labeled* injected fraud and measures each detector's precision, recall and
— most importantly — its false-positive rate against a clean universe, checked
against committed baselines in `evals/baseline.json`. A detector that fires on
clean data is worse than one that fires on nothing.

Synthetic fixtures have their own failure mode: model a column CVM does not
publish and the eval will happily score a detector that can never run on real
data. `evals/cvm_headers.json` records the real CVM headers, and
`tests/test_eval_fixture_schema.py` drives the actual readers over them to check
that no fixture column is invented and no scored detector is missing an input.

## Layout

```
config/       Settings and detection thresholds
src/
  collectors/ CVM downloads
  processors/ CSV parsing, normalization, flow derivation

```

`src/utils/cnpj_utils.py` is the single source of truth for CNPJ handling. CNPJ
is the join key across every dataset here, so normalization lives in exactly one
place — see the module docstring for the rules.
